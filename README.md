EPW Parser
Overview:
This application processes EPW climate data files provided in either .zip or .epw formats. It cleans and standardizes the data for further use, and creates a combined index file that can be used to search for available locations and determine the most appropriate, up-to-date weather data file.

How It Works:

Accepts input files in .zip or .epw formats.

Extracts and parses relevant weather data.

Cleans and normalizes the data into a consistent format.

Generates a unified index file that includes metadata for all processed locations.

Enables easy searching of locations and identification of the latest, most relevant weather data file for each area.

Data Source:
The weather data used by this application is sourced from:
https://climate.onebuilding.org/

How to Use:

Place your .zip or .epw files into the input directory.

Run the parser application.

The cleaned data and index file will be saved to the output directory.

Use the index file to search for a location and find the most suitable weather file.
